# Security Measures and Best Practices

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Formulario de Horas application to address common vulnerabilities identified by security scans.

## ‚úÖ Implemented Security Measures

### 1. Frontend Security (React/TypeScript)

#### Input Validation and Sanitization
- **Enhanced Input Validation**: Implemented comprehensive input validation with type-specific patterns
- **Sanitization**: All user inputs are sanitized to prevent XSS and injection attacks
- **Length Limits**: Maximum length restrictions on all input fields
- **Pattern Matching**: Regex patterns for project codes, dates, employee IDs, etc.

#### HTTP Security
- **CSRF Protection**: CSRF tokens are automatically added to non-GET requests
- **Security Headers**: Added X-Requested-With and X-Content-Type-Options headers
- **Timeout Configuration**: 30-second timeout to prevent hanging requests
- **Redirect Limits**: Maximum 5 redirects to prevent redirect loops

#### SSRF Prevention
- **Domain Whitelisting**: Only allows requests to approved domains
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: Forces HTTPS in production environment
- **URL Validation**: Comprehensive URL parsing and validation

### 2. Backend Security (FastAPI/Python)

#### Dependencies
- **Security Audits**: Regular dependency scanning with `pip-audit`
- **Up-to-date Packages**: All packages are kept current with security patches
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Only necessary packages included

### 3. Authentication and Authorization
- **Token-based Auth**: Secure token handling for API authentication
- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation of all inputs
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages that don't leak sensitive information

## üîç Security Scan Results

### Resolved Issues
- ‚úÖ **TypeScript Errors**: Fixed missing `@types/node` dependency
- ‚úÖ **Missing Dependencies**: Installed `slowapi` package
- ‚úÖ **Input Validation**: Enhanced client-side validation
- ‚úÖ **HTTP Security**: Added security headers and CSRF protection

### Third-party Dependencies (Not Actionable)
The following vulnerabilities are in third-party packages and cannot be fixed directly:

- **@supabase/node-fetch**: SSRF and HTTP-to-HTTPS issues
- **@remix-run/router**: Open Redirect vulnerabilities
- **axios**: Insufficient postMessage validation, cookie security
- **tailwindcss**: ReDoS vulnerabilities
- **ws, form-data**: Various security issues

**Recommendation**: Monitor these dependencies and update to newer versions when security patches become available.

## üõ°Ô∏è Additional Security Recommendations

### 1. Environment Configuration
```bash
# Ensure production environment variables are set
NODE_ENV=production
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=https://your-secure-domain.com
```

### 2. Content Security Policy (CSP)
Consider implementing CSP headers in your web server:
```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'
```

### 3. HTTPS Enforcement
Ensure your production environment enforces HTTPS:
```nginx
# Example nginx configuration
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com;
    return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
}
```

### 4. Rate Limiting
The backend includes `slowapi` for rate limiting. Configure it according to your needs.

### 5. Monitoring and Logging
- Implement proper logging for security events
- Monitor for unusual patterns in API usage
- Set up alerts for failed authentication attempts

## üîß Maintenance Tasks

### Regular Security Audits
```bash
# Frontend
cd frontend && npm audit
cd frontend && npm audit fix

# Backend
cd backend && pip-audit
cd backend && pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

### Dependency Updates
```bash
# Update all dependencies
cd frontend && npm update
cd backend && pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```
